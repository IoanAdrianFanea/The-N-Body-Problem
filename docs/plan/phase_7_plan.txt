PHASE 7 – VISUALIZATION AND INTERFACE
Initial Plan + Workflow

OBJECTIVE
Phase 7 improves the project presentation and usability by adding reproducible demo scenes, a single command-line runner, and clear visual outputs (plots + optional animation). The physics model, solvers, and integrators remain unchanged.

SCOPE
This phase includes:
- Predefined simulation scenes (repeatable initial conditions)
- A command-line entry point to run demos without editing source code
- Plot outputs for trajectories and diagnostic drift
- Optional matplotlib animation (2D default, 3D optional)

PLANNED COMPONENTS

1) Simulation Scenes
A small set of predefined systems for consistent demonstrations:
- Two-body orbit system
- Three-body system (chaotic behaviour)
- Random N-body cluster
- Optional disk / galaxy-like distribution (time permitting)

Scenes will be reproducible using fixed parameters or a seeded random generator.

2) Demo Runner (Command-Line)
A standalone script acts as the main entry point for running simulations.

Planned CLI features:
- Scene selection
- Solver selection (Direct or Barnes–Hut)
- Integrator selection (Euler or Leapfrog)
- Parameter control (dt, steps, N, θ, softening)
- Output control (save/show, output folder, filenames)
- Optional animation controls (enable/disable, 2D/3D, sampling interval)

3) Visualization Outputs (Plots)
Plots generated from simulation results:
- Final position plot (default: XY projection)
- Energy drift plot over time
- Optional momentum / angular momentum drift plots

Plots are intended for clear inspection and portfolio screenshots.

4) Animation (Matplotlib)
A basic matplotlib animation will be supported for demonstration.

Design approach:
- Simulation runs normally.
- Positions are recorded every K steps (sampling), producing frames.
- Animation plays recorded frames after the run completes.

Animation modes:
- Default: 2D (XY projection) for clarity and performance
- Optional: 3D animation mode (intended for small systems due to rendering cost)
- Optional: static 3D plot of final state regardless of animation mode

5) Output Management
All outputs are saved to a dedicated outputs directory.
File naming includes scene and configuration details (scene, solver, integrator, N, θ).

NON-GOALS
Out of scope for Phase 7:
- GUI frameworks
- Real-time interactive rendering tied to simulation steps
- Performance optimisation work (unless animation becomes unusable)
- Major refactoring of solvers or integrators

DOCUMENTATION AND LOGGING
Phase 7 summary file is used as a rough working log during development.
At the end of the phase, the summary is cleaned into a final write-up and supported by the main documentation file.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
Phase 7 is complete when:
- Simulations can be run using one command-line script
- At least three predefined scenes are available
- Final position plot and energy drift plot are generated and saved
- 2D matplotlib animation works for demo-sized systems
- 3D mode is optional (implemented if time allows) or clearly documented if not included
- The project can be demonstrated without modifying source files

PHASE 7 DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE

1) phase_7_changes.txt
- Used during development
- Tracks detailed changes and reasoning
- Updated after each implementation step

2) phase_7_summary.txt
- High-level phase summary 
- Cleaned and written at the end of Phase 7
- Intended for portfolio / review

3) phase_7_performance.txt
- this may be necessary if testing becomes large
- if so, testing for phase 7 is moved from EXPERIMENT_LOG to its own testing file

INITIAL WORKFLOW (HOW WORK WILL BE DONE)

1) Setup and structure
- Create Phase 7 summary file (rough log format)
- Create /outputs directory (tracked or with placeholder file)

2) Implement in small steps (commit-based)
- Step A: Add scenes module (two_body, three_body, cluster, optional disk)
- Step B: Add demo runner script with argparse (run without plots first)
- Step C: Add plotting utilities (final XY + energy drift)
- Step D: Add frame recording (sample every K steps)
- Step E: Add 2D animation using recorded frames
- Step F (optional): Add 3D final plot and optional 3D animation mode

3) Testing after each step
- Run small N tests (N <= 50) to confirm correctness and visuals
- Run medium N tests (N ~ 500–2000) to confirm Barnes–Hut demos and plot speed
- Confirm output files are generated with correct naming

4) Logging while building
- After each step, add to Phase 7 changes:
  - what changed (files)
  - reasons
  - what worked
  - issues / fixes 
  - what has been kept (if not why)
  - next action

5) End-of-phase consolidation
- Rewrite Phase 7 summary into a clean final summary
- Add short “How to run demos” section to README or documentation file

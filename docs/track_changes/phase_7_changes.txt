[Step A – Scenes] 

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added code/nbody/scenes.py
- Implemented two_body, three_body, random_cluster, disk scenes

REASONS:
- Provide reproducible starting systems for Phase 7 demos

WHAT WORKED:
- Scenes integrate cleanly with existing Body class
- Seeded randomness gives reproducible clusters and disks

ISSUES/ FIXES
- Initial attempt used tuple-based Body constructor (fixed)
- Adjusted velocity and mass ranges for stability

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT
- Function-based scenes instead of classes (simpler design)

NEXT ACTION
- Implement demo runner (CLI)





DATE
04/02/2026
[Step B – Demo Runner (CLI)]

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added code/nbody/cli.py as the main command-line entry point
- Implemented run subcommand to execute predefined scenes via argparse
- Implemented list-scenes subcommand for scene discovery
- Added argument parsing for scene, solver, integrator, timestep, steps, softening, and Barnes–Hut theta
- Added input validation for dt and steps
- Added optional --energy flag to enable energy diagnostics
- Added placeholder flags for plotting and animation (not implemented yet)

REASONS:
- Provide a reproducible and user-friendly way to run Phase 7 demos without editing source code
- Decouple simulation configuration from hardcoded scripts
- Establish a stable interface for later visualization and plotting steps

WHAT WORKED:
- CLI integrates cleanly with existing Simulation, solvers, and integrators
- Scene presets run successfully using sensible default parameters
- Argument validation prevents invalid or unsafe simulation configurations
- Help output clearly documents available options and defaults

ISSUES / FIXES:
- Scenes requiring parameters (e.g. disk, random_cluster) initially failed when called without arguments
- Fixed by introducing explicit default scene loaders in the CLI
- Early versions accessed subcommand arguments outside their scope
- Fixed by restructuring control flow around run and list-scenes

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT:
- Single run command with flags rather than multiple configuration subcommands
- Explicit demo defaults for scenes instead of exposing all scene parameters
- CLI-focused validation rather than pushing checks into simulation core

NEXT ACTION:
- Implement plotting utilities (final XY snapshot + energy drift)
- Wire --plots flag to visualization code (Phase 7 Step C)





DATE
05/02/2026
[Step C – Plot Outputs + Diagnostics]

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added/updated code/nbody/viz.py for plotting utilities and output saving.
- Wired the CLI --plots flag to generate and save figures into outputs/<timestamped_run_dir>/.
- Added plots:
  - final_xy_full.png (full view, includes escapers)
  - final_xy_zoom.png (clipped view for readability)
  - energy_drift.png (energy drift over time)

REASONS:
- Make runs easier to inspect without manual debugging.
- Provide visual evidence of stability/instability (especially for disk/cluster scenes).
- Save outputs in a consistent place for reports and demos.

WHAT WORKED:
- Output folder structure is clear and reproducible (timestamped run directories).
- Full + zoom plots solved the “one escaper ruins the scale” problem.
- Energy drift plot helped diagnose unstable parameter choices.

ISSUES / FIXES:
- Energy drift originally looked “broken” because the system can be numerically unstable
  (large dt / low softening) and because normalisation can be misleading.
- Fixed/updated energy drift calculation to use a stable scale:
  - E_scale = max(|E0|, |K0| + |U0|, eps)
  - drift = |E - E0| / E_scale
- Also confirmed stability by comparing Direct vs Barnes–Hut with the same dt/softening.

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT:
- Plots are simple Matplotlib (no extra dependencies).
- Plotting code lives in viz.py and the CLI only calls functions (separation of concerns).

NEXT ACTION:
- Add frame sampling for animation (Step D)
- Add CLI animation playback (Step E)





DATE
07/02/2026
[Step D – Frame Sampling for Animation]

WHAT CHANGED:
- Added frame recording support in Simulation/SimulationConfig:
  - record_frames (bool)
  - frame_every (int)
- Recorded the initial frame during simulation initialization.
- Recorded sampled frames during stepping (every frame_every steps).
- Cleared frames at the start of each run to avoid mixing runs.

REASONS:
- Animation should not require storing every full SystemState.
- Sampling keeps memory reasonable and makes animation fast enough for demos.

WHAT WORKED:
- Frames are lightweight (positions only).
- Sampling rate is configurable and independent from diagnostics.

ISSUES / FIXES:
- Without recording the initial frame, animation starts “mid-run” (fixed by saving frame 0).
- Without clearing frames, repeated runs could append (fixed with frames.clear()).

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT:
- state_history is still available for diagnostics, but animation uses frames (clean separation).

NEXT ACTION:
- Implement a 2D XY animation function and expose it via CLI (Step E)





DATE
07/02/2026
[Step E – 2D Animation via CLI + Scene Fixes]

WHAT CHANGED:
- Implemented animate_xy(...) in code/nbody/viz.py using matplotlib FuncAnimation.
- Updated CLI:
  - --animate (show animation after simulation)
  - --frame-every (controls sampling)
  - --interval (controls playback speed)
- Tuned scenes to match the project’s unit system (G = 4*pi^2):
  - two_body now auto-computes a sensible orbit speed if v is not provided.
  - three_body changed to a stable “figure-eight” setup and velocities scaled by sqrt(G).
  - random_cluster can be virialised (velocity rescale to make it roughly bound).
  - disk default v_scale increased so it rotates instead of instantly collapsing for demos.
- Cleaned up docstrings/comments to be shorter and more “student style”.

REASONS:
- Make Phase 7 demos visual and easy to run from one command.
- Fix confusing behaviour caused by using G=4*pi^2 with scene velocities tuned for G=1.
- Make the code easier to read and explain in the report.

WHAT WORKED:
- Animations run for two_body / disk / figure-eight three_body.
- Playback speed can be controlled without changing physics (interval + frame_every).
- Scenes now behave closer to what the user expects for demo purposes.

ISSUES / FIXES:
- Some scenes initially “collapsed then scattered” or “slingshotted” due to velocity mismatch with G.
- Fixed by adjusting scene initial velocities rather than changing G.
- Animation initially looked “too fast” (fixed by using interval/frame sampling, not physics changes).

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT:
- Animation is 2D (XY) only for simplicity.
- Scene functions stay simple and reproducible (seeded randomness).

NEXT ACTION:
- (Optional) Add saving animations to GIF/MP4.
- (Optional) Make simulation more aesthetically pleasing 
- (Optional) Add 3D final plot and optional 3D animation mode
- Finalise Phase 7 summary + README examples.






DATE
18/02/2026
[Step E – Aesthetic Improvements (Space-Style Visualization Defaults)]

WHAT CHANGED:
- Updated 2D animation visuals in code/nbody/viz.py to use a consistent “space” theme by default:
  - Black background and static starfield (small white points).
  - Cleaner framing (equal aspect + fixed axis limits using robust percentile bounds to avoid edge clipping).
  - Adjusted marker sizing to scale with particle count (small-N readable, large-N not overcrowded).
- Simplified CLI behaviour:
  - Introduced per-scene run presets (dt, steps, softening, frame sampling, interval).
  - Ensured `run --scene X --animate` produces a stable demo without extra flags.
  - Improved list-scenes output to display scene defaults and run presets.

REASONS:
- Make the project more portfolio-ready with a clean and consistent visual identity.
- Reduce command complexity and avoid excessive CLI tuning.
- Fix visual artefacts such as edge clipping and over-zoomed framing without changing physics.

WHAT WORKED:
- Animations are clearer and more cinematic with space-style background.
- Disk and random_cluster no longer exhibit bodies visually “stuck” at plot boundaries.
- Scene-specific presets provide stable motion without manual dt/softening adjustments.
- Minimal command usage now produces clean demo-quality output.

ISSUES / FIXES:
- Some scenes appeared too zoomed in or too zoomed out.
- Resolved via percentile-based camera bounds with controlled padding.
- Large-N scenes looked cluttered when marker size was increased.
- Resolved by scaling body size based on particle count.
- Current issues faced with 'disk' scene, to be fixed in a second optimisation phase (due to length of runs)

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT:
- 2D XY animation using matplotlib FuncAnimation.
- Seeded scene generation for reproducibility.
- Separation of physics, CLI, and visualization logic.

NEXT ACTION:
- (Optional) Add saving animations to GIF/MP4.
- (Optional) Implement 3D animation mode.
- Finalise Phase 7 summary and update README examples.

[Step F – Animation Saving Implementation]

WHAT CHANGED
- Modified code/nbody/viz.py:
  - Added save_animation(...) helper.
  - Added GIF export via PillowWriter.
  - Added MP4 export via FFMpegWriter.
  - Updated animate_xy(...) to accept:
    - out_path
    - fps
    - show flag
  - Ensured animate_xy returns saved file path or None.
  - Updated run logic:
    - Ensured all bodies are plotted (previous version included tracer particle to test, however this was removed)
- Modified code/nbody/cli.py:
  - Added CLI flags:
    --save-gif
    --save-mp4
    --fps
    --no-show
  - Updated run logic:
    - Created output directory if plots OR animation saving enabled.
    - Ensured plots and animations share the same folder.
    - Prevented duplicate directory creation.

REASONS
- Avoid losing long simulation runs by forgetting to save.
- Keep reproducible artifacts for demos and documentation.
- Maintain separation between simulation logic and export logic.

WHAT WORKED
- GIF export works without additional dependencies.
- MP4 export works when ffmpeg is available.
- Saving and showing animation simultaneously works.
- Saving without opening a window works (--no-show).
- Output folder structure remains consistent.

ISSUES / FIXES
- Initially run_dir was not created before saving → fixed by creating it when needed.
- Duplicate output folder creation in CLI → removed.
- animate_xy could crash if saving was not enabled → fixed by initializing saved = None.

WHAT HAS BEEN KEPT
- Physics, integrators, and solvers unchanged.
- 2D animation pipeline unchanged apart from export support.
- Existing output folder naming convention retained.

NEXT ACTION
- (Optional) Implement 3D final plot and/or 3D animation mode.
- Finalise Phase 7 documentation and README examples.
